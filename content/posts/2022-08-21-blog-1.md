I've found myself stuck in a consumer mode.
I think the world is better when people contribute what is uniquely them.
I'm not sure where this is going, but I'm going to be posting to this site daily.
I think a lot about self-custody of information, which is why this isn't going on something like Substack, as much as I love their ethos.

I hear a lot from people about how they want to get into tech but aren't sure how.
I think there's limits to the abilities for some people, but most people are limited more by their own beliefs.
There's a little sleepy demon on your shoulder that says "not today, you're a little tired" or "it won't matter, no one will care you do"
I think we all have to kill that demon inside us, and listen instead to the angry little bastard deep in our hearts.
This angry bastard knows when things aren't right and when we aren't living up to our potential.
We'll all die someday, and I'd rather die thinking I had given my best, as best I could.

Some might call this "Spiritual Autolysis", a term coined by author Jed McKenna.
I'm not sure about that, but I know this is an attempt to connect with a raw anger/passion that I know lives within me.
I will connect with my inner passion, whatever form that takes.
I will ignore the people who don't understand.
